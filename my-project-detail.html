        A lion was once sleeping in the jungle when a mouse started running up
        and down his body just for fun. This disturbed the lion’s sleep, and he
        woke up quite angry. He was about to eat the mouse when the mouse
        desperately requested the lion to set him free. “I promise you, I will
        be of great help to you someday if you save me.” The lion laughed at the
        mouse’s confidence and let him go. One day, a few hunters came into the
        forest and took the lion with them. They tied him up against a tree. The
        lion was struggling to get out and started to whimper. Soon, the mouse
        walked past and noticed the lion in trouble. Quickly, he ran and gnawed
        on the ropes to set the lion free. Both of them sped off into the
        jungle.
